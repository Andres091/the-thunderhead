The Thunderhead is a bot based on the popular book series Arc of a Scythe by Neal Shusterman (which you should totally read) that takes place in the future in a “utopian” society featuring immortality for everyone... until you get gleaned by a scythe. The series includes an AI they call “The Thunderhead.” The Thunderhead is basically “The Cloud,” but it knows everything and observes _almost_ everything. This bot is r/scythebookfans and r/scytheposts recreation of that: a multilanguage multiuse Discord self-operating program featuring an economy with a market and real-time stocks, music, math solving power, Arc of a Scythe themed question asking and answering, and more!

## Current Ver. ☁️🐦 3.0.4 | Storage

  The thunderhead cannot intervene in affairs of the Scythedom. All it can do is watch; with an unblinking eye.
